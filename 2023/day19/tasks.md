# Day 19 Task: Brush up your Docker knowledge with Docker Volumes and Networking.


## Docker Volumes
Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container. The data doesn't persist when that container no longer exists, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.

## What is Docker Networking
Docker networking enables a user to link a Docker container to as many networks as he/she requires. Docker Networks are used to provide complete isolation for Docker containers. Note: A user can add containers to more than one network.

## Tasks-1

* Create a Docker volume using the command `docker volume create [volume_name]`
* Launch a container using the command `docker run -d -v [volume_name]:/data alpine sh` where `[volume_name]` is the volume you created in step 1 and `/data` is the location where the volume will be mounted within the container.
* Verify that the volume is properly mounted by running the command `docker exec -it [container_name] sh` and then running the command `ls /data` within the container.

## Tasks-2

* Create a user-defined bridge network using the command `docker network create --driver bridge [network_name]`.
* Launch a new container and connect it to the bridge network you created in step 4 using the command `docker run -d --network [network_name] alpine sh`.
* Verify that the container is connected to the network by running the command `docker network inspect [network_name]` and looking for the container in the output.
* Create a new container and connect it to the same network as the previous container, but also pass in environment variables using the command `docker run -d --network [network_name] -e VAR1=VALUE1 -e VAR2=VALUE2 alpine sh`
* Verify that the environment variables are set by running the command `docker exec -it [container_name] sh` and then running the command printenv within the container.
